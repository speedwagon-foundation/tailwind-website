        <div class="content">
            <p>While classic CSS follows the principle of defining the styling of a website in a separate CSS file,
                utility based CSS takes a different approach by applying the styles directly where they are needed in
                the HTML. Utility based in this context means that there are a wide variety of mini classes which often
                only include one CSS property in them. These mini classes can be for example a class called "flex" which
                only includes the "display: flex;" property. So now rather than adding one class for an HTML element and
                then applying multiple styles to it in a separate CSS file, one can now utilize a mixture of those mini
                classes to define how it should look. The widest spread implementation of this concept is called
                TailwindCSS, on which the focus of this website will also be. </p>

            <p>
                Tailwind's Creator Adam Wathan created a Less stylesheet with lots of utility classes like "pad-x" for
                his side projects back in 2015. Over multiple projects he kept refining it and after some discussion
                with
                his now business partner Steve Schoger and through community feedback he received while streaming,
                Wathan decided in Spring of 2017 to polish his stylesheet enough to be able to open source it.
                <br>
                <br>
                By late 2017 they released a first version of their stylesheet on Github and dubbed it Tailwind.
                Fast-forward to May 2019 where they published version 1.0, their first big release. Over the years
                Tailwind
                has accumulated an astonishing amount of over 51 thousand stars on Github.

        </header>
        <div class="content">
            <p>At first sight, this all seems like it is just a fancy way of doing inline CSS, and yes while it kind of
                is, utility based CSS has numerous advantages.
                <br>
                <br>
                For one using classes instead of directly applying a style enhances the readability of the code by a
                fair bit. This approach furthermore still retains the benefit of being able to infer the styling of the
                HTML tag without referring to the associated CSS File.
                <br>
                <br>
                Utility based CSS also enables various CSS features that otherwise would not be possible. Anything that
                conditionally changes the styling of a tag like "hover" or "focus" is not feasible with inline CSS.
                To apply a class only when a certain condition is met, Tailwind provides prefixes which define when it
                should be applied.
                <br>
                <br>
                These prefixes furthermore also enable the use of media queries to create a cohesive and responsive
                webpage.
                In the same spirit styles can now also only be added when the screen size exceeds a certain breakpoint.

                For anyone wanting to get started right away with developing a website, tailwind provides a wide variety
                of predefined
                of colors, breakpoints, font-sizes and much more out of the box. These allow for quick development
                without having to worry about the same basic things over and over again. All of these settings can be
                overridden, so deciding later on to change the color palette for example can be easily done in the
                accompanying config file.

        </header>
        <div class="content">
            <p>As is has already quickly been alluded to before, with Tailwind it is possible to easily implement a
                responsive design for a website. By default, there are five breakpoints available ranging from small to
                large.
                Of course those can also be modified to the developers liking. It is important to note that Tailwind
                utilizes a mobile first approach. This means that a style that is defined without a prefixed breakpoint
                is valid until it gets overridden by a style that has a breakpoint attached to it.
                <br>
                <br>
                On the topic of responsive design, Tailwind also offers support for a feature that has gained traction
                in recent years:
                dark-mode. To set a style only for dark-mode, Tailwind provides the "dark:" prefix.

                To start developing websites with Tailwind, one must first download the Tailwind-package "tailwindcss"
                via npm.
                This will install the required files in the associated folders for the current project.
                Afterwards a configuration file needs to be created which can be generated via the "npx tailwindcss
                init" command.
                The files in which tailwind classes will be used, must now be inserted into the configuration file.
                At least one CSS file is required in which Tailwind's directives need to be inserted.
                Through another command a watcher gets started that automatically generates a new output CSS file
                whenever
                there's a change to one of the source files. Only the generated output file needs to be included into
                the website to make everything work.

            <p>After working with Tailwind for some time we noticed just how much time it was saving us. We no longer
                had to think of arbitrary class names and could just add exactly the styles that we needed. There are
                also
                lots of classes that help a lot with styling like the shadows for example.
                <br>
                <br>
                There are however still some things where we had to rely on self written CSS classes to avoid
                duplication.
                Since the Tailwind classes need to be applied directly to a tag, it gets clustered really easily if have
                to add the same classes to each tag over and over again. In its defense, Tailwind does however allow to
                apply its styles via a CSS file using the prefix "@apply" inside a CSS class, so we could still use
                everything provided by Tailwind, while making use of the css selector we needed.
